            <h1>The Adrestian Empire</h1>
        </div>
        <h2>General</h2>
        <p>The Adrestian Empire encompasses the southern part of Fódlan, a relatively lush and bountiful region with
            ample access to the sea. It is ruled by a dynasty that can be traced back over 1,000 years to its legendary
            founder, Great Emperor Wilhelm Paul Hresvelg, who is said to have been crowned by Saint Seiros herself. Its
            capital city is Enbarr, the largest city in Fódlan, which was chosen for its association with Seiros.
            Adrestian Empire Founding Day is celebrated annually on the 1st of the Great Tree Moon.</p>
        <p>In recent decades, the Empire's longstanding relationship with the Church of Seiros has cooled due to a
            political rift, with some believing that the Church's strength comes at the Empire's expense. As a result,
            the Church's influence and following within the Empire have diminished substantially. Halfway in the game,
            Edelgard succeeds the crown and declares war on the Church and the other two nations.</p>
        <p>Garreg Mach Monastery in central Fódlan organizes its Officer's Academy students into three houses, with
            each house representing a different nation. <a href="BlackEagles.html" class="BE">Students from the Adrestian Empire are members of the Black
                Eagles.</a></p>
        <h2>Politics</h2>
        <p>The Adrestian Empire is a hereditary monarchy with a rigid hierarchy. All important government ministries
            and leadership positions are passed down through the same noble families, generation after generation,
            although that has not stopped political maneuvering among the nobles.</p>
        <p>House Hresvelg, the royal family, wielded supreme authority over the Empire until the Insurrection of the
            Seven in Imperial Year 1171, in which much of its power was stripped away by the nobility. The head of House
            Aegir occupies the post of prime minister, with the title being hereditary. House Vestra is responsible for
            managing the darker tasks of the Empire, as well as the emperor's periphery affairs, including coordinating
            affairs such as ceremonies and rituals, Imperial consorts, and the Imperial Guard. House Hevring has rule
            over the Empire's domestic affairs, particularly those relating to administration, finance, and the
            judiciary. House Bergliez rules over the Empire's Ministry of Military Affairs and commands all of the
            armies that do not directly belong to the emperor. House Varley is responsible for the Empire's Ministry of
            Religion, whose main responsibility is to maintain amiable relations with the Church of Seiros. House Gerth
            directs the Empire's diplomacy, foreign relations, and relations between various provinces and the capital.
            It worked hard to secure the ceasefires that ended the Dagda and Brigid War in 1175.</p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The Adrestian Empire was founded in Imperial Year 1 by Great Emperor Wilhelm I, with its name gifted by an
            oracle. Between Imperial Year 32 and 98, Wilhelm and his successor, Lycaon I, fought to unify Fódlan under
            their rule with the aid of Saint Seiros and her Church in what became known as the War of Heroes. The nobles
            who opposed this were united under Nemesis, the King of Liberation. In 91, Seiros personally killed Nemesis
            at the Battle of Tailtean, and the war concluded in 98 with the demise of Lycaon I. At this time, the Empire
            ruled the whole of Fódlan.</p>
        <p>Following the First Mach War of 721, in which Dagda invaded the land of Mach and was repelled by Imperial
            forces, the Empire conquered the Dagdan ally of Brigid in 728, which has remained a vassal ever since. The
            Empire attempted a large-scale invasion of Dagda in 731, but were ultimately defeated.</p>
        <p>In 747, Loog of House Blaiddyd rallied the nobles of the Faerghus region in rebellion against the Empire.
            The War of the Eagle and Lion ended in 751, when Loog defeated the Emperor at the Tailtean Plains. The
            Church of Seiros mediated peace between the two sides, resulting in the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus securing
            its independence and Loog being crowned its first king.</p>
        <p>In 801, the Leicester region also rebelled against the Empire, which found itself unable to reassert
            control. The Kingdom saw an opportunity to increase its political power and invaded, occupying and annexing
            Leicester. In 861, the three sons of the late King Klaus I divided the Kingdom between themselves, and in
            881, upon the death of their ruling archduke, the nobles of Leicester once again fought for independence.
            The Crescent Moon War ended in 901 with the founding of the Leicester Alliance.</p>
        <p>In 961, the Empire assisted the Alliance in turning back an invasion from Almyra. This prompted the three
            countries of Fódlan to begin cooperating to defend against foreign invasions. This led to the construction
            of Fódlan's Locket, a fortress in the mountains of Fódlan's Throat designed to counter Almyran incursions,
            in 1101.</p>
        <p>Around 1065, the Southern Church, based in Enbarr, led a massive insurrection throughout the Empire which
            was eventually quelled. The Emperor exiled the regional bishop who instigated the uprising and dissolved the
            dissident Church. Afterwards, a Ministry of Religion under House Varley was created to maintain relations
            with the Church of Seiros.</p>
        <p>Emperor Ionius IX was crowned sometime before 1162, when his daughter and heir apparent Edelgard was born.
            In 1171, the Duke of Aegir seized power in an uprising called the Insurrection of the Seven, reducing Ionius
            IX to a figurehead. A young Princess Edelgard was taken to Faerghus by her uncle, Lord Volkhard Arundel, who
            was also one of the conspirators; both returned to the Empire in 1174.</p>
        <p>In 1175, the nations of Dagda and Brigid invaded the Empire in the territories of Nuvelle and Ochs. The
            Empire eventually repelled the invasion and triumphed, forcing the defeated Brigid into vassalage. As a
            token of Brigid's new allegiance, Petra, the granddaughter of the king of Brigid, was sent to live in the
            Empire.</p>
