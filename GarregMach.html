        <h1>Garreg Mach Monastery</h1>
        <h2>general</h2>
        <p>Located in central Fódlan amidst the mountains, Garreg Mach Monastery is the headquarters of two separate
            entities: the Church of Seiros and the Officers Academy. It is a neutral territory, not governed by any of
            the three nations of Fódlan. In addition to being a religious site, the monastery is home to an elite order
            of knights.</p>
        <p>Deep underground below Garreg Mach Monastery lies a series of secret tunnels that lead to an entire
            underground town known simply as Abyss. There lies various vagabonds who find solace in the depths. Their
            reasons for coming to Abyss varies, some could be shunned nobility, merchants, or
            simply looking for some peace.</p>
        <h2>history</h2>
        <p>The Church's founder and namesake, Saint Seiros, was said to have been given a revelation, a "gift to help
            guide the lost", from the Goddess who was watching over Fódlan. Seiros first appeared in the Enbarr region
            of Fódlan 41 years before the founding of the Adrestian Empire. She performed miracles that inspired the
            people, and the Church of Seiros was founded to venerate her.

            The Adrestian Empire was founded in Imperial Year 0 by Great Emperor Wilhelm I, with Enbarr chosen as its
            capital due to the presence of Seiros. In Imperial Year 32, Wilhelm I launched the War of Heroes with the
            goal of conquering all of Fódlan for the Empire. Nemesis, the King of Liberation, united the Empire's
            opponents under his leadership. Seiros finally slew Nemesis at the Battle of Tailtean in Imperial Year 91,
            but the war did not end until 98, when Wilhelm I's successor, Lycaon I, succumbed to illness.

            In Imperial Year 185, Garreg Mach Monastery was completed. Shortly after, Seiros and the Four Apostles
            attempted the Rite of Rising to resurrect the Goddess, but the ritual failed and the chalice used to preform
            the ritual was sealed away.

            In Imperial Year 751, the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus seceded from the Empire after winning the War of the
            Eagle and Lion. The Church crowned Faerghus's first king, Loog of House Blaiddyd, and granted his nation
            autonomy. In 801, the region of Leicester rebelled against the Empire, and the Kingdom took the opportunity
            to occupy the region. In 861, the death of King Klaus I led his three sons to partition the Kingdom into
            three parts, with each of them ruling a certain part as an archduke. The death of the archduke of Leicester
            in 881 gave the Leicester lords the chance to form an alliance rather than accept his heir, sparking the
            Crescent Moon War. In 901, the war ended with the founding of the Leicester Alliance under the leadership of
            the influential Duke of Riegan. The constant threat of invasion from countries surrounding the continent
            eventually forced these three powers to band together under the Church.

            Around 1065, the Southern Church, based in the Imperial capital, incited a massive uprising that engulfed
            the Empire. In the aftermath, the Southern Church was dissolved and replaced by the Ministry of Religion led
            by House Varley.

            In the present era, the three nations exist in relative peace and equilibrium, largely thanks to the
            mediating influence of the Church and the efforts of Archbishop Rhea. The Church also runs the Officers
            Academy, which trains the royalty and nobility of Fódlan in the arts of warfare, magic, and leadership.</p>
