        <h1>The holy Kingdom of Faerghus</h1>
        <h2>General</h2>
        <p>The Holy Kingdom of Faerghus lies in the north of F贸dlan, a cold, rugged land that has forced its people to
            adapt. It is ruled by the royal House Blaiddyd and a number of knightly orders. The nation was founded by
            Loog, the legendary King of Lions. Its capital city is Fhirdiad, which is also home to a prestigious school
            of sorcery. Holy Kingdom of Faerghus Founding Day is celebrated annually on the 21st of the Red Wolf Moon.
        </p>
        <p>Garreg Mach Monastery in central F贸dlan organizes its students into three houses, with each house
            representing a different nation. Students from the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus are members of the Blue Lions.
        </p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Originally, the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus was part of the Adrestian Empire. In Imperial Year 747, Loog of
            House Blaiddyd, a direct descendant of one of the Ten Elites of the War of Heroes, led Faerghus in rebellion
            against the Adrestian Empire in the War of the Eagle and Lion. Loog claimed victory in 751, after defeating
            the Emperor at the Tailtean Plains. The Church of Seiros mediated between Faerghus and the Empire, resulting
            in the creation of the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus and Loog being crowned its first king.</p>
        <p>In 801, the Leicester region also rebelled against the Empire, which was unable to reassert control. The
            Kingdom intervened by occupying and annexing Leicester as a protectorate. In 861, the three sons of the late
            King Klaus I divided the Kingdom into three archduchies: the Eastern Kingdom, the Western Kingdom, and
            Leicester. In 881, upon the death of Leicester's archduke, the nobles of Leicester rejected his heir and
            launched a second bid for independence upon the instigation of House Riegan, a cadet branch of the Blaiddyd
            royal family. The resulting Crescent Moon War ended in 901 with the nobles of Leicester seceding from
            Faerghus to form the Leicester Alliance.</p>
        <p>In 1101, the Kingdom cooperated with the Empire and the Alliance to construct F贸dlan's Locket, a fortress in
            the mountains of F贸dlan's Throat, as a safeguard against further invasions from Almyra.</p>
        <p>Around 1160, a plague ravaged the nation and the Queen Consort died shortly after giving birth to Crown
            Prince Dimitri in 1162. The mage Cornelia gained influence within the royal court after stopping the
            outbreak. Around 1168, King Lambert, accompanied by his trusted advisor Rodrigue, invaded Sreng and annexed
            the southern half of the region after the campaign's success. During the Insurrection of the Seven, Patricia
            von Arundel, the wife of Emperor Ionius IX of the Adrestian Empire, was betrothed to Lambert and did not
            return to the Empire when her daughter Edelgard departed Faerghus in 1174. Two years later, numerous nobles
            and royals, including King Lambert, Queen Consort Patricia, and Glenn, Rodrigue's firstborn son, were
            assassinated; only Dimitri survived. The people of Duscur were blamed for the attack and persecuted for
            regicide in what became known as the Tragedy of Duscur. The late king's brother, Grand Duke Rufus of Itha,
            assumed regency over the Kingdom in Dimitri's stead. In 1178, Dimitri distinguished himself by quelling a
            rebellion in the Kingdom's west. The Grand Duke's reign has led to a period of decline throughout the
            Kingdom. The nation is plagued by civil strife and hardship, rumors suggest the deterioration in governance
            is a result of the Regent's womanizing.</p>
