        <h1>The Leicester Alliance</h1>
        <h2>General</h2>
        <p>The Leicester Alliance is located in eastern Fódlan, a temperate region of plains and mountains. Leicester
            Alliance Founding Day is celebrated annually on the 8th of the Horsebow Moon.</p>
        <p>In contrast with the other two countries of Fódlan, the Alliance's relationship with the Church of Seiros is
            neither especially warm nor antagonistic.</p>
        <p>Garreg Mach Monastery in central Fódlan organizes its students into three houses, with each house
            representing a different nation. Students from the Leicester Alliance are members of the Golden Deer.</p>
        <h2>Politics</h2>
        <p>Unlike other territories, the Leicester Alliance is a league of multiple noble families who refuse to swear
            fealty to any king or emperor. Instead, the Alliance is ruled jointly as a confederacy through roundtable
            conferences between the five most prominent allied dukes called the Five Great Lords, which is led by House
            Riegan and joined by the heads of House Goneril, House Gloucester, House Ordelia and House Edmund, all of
            which convene at the capital city of Derdriu. Each house's territory is technically an autonomous region,
            though they all swear reciprocal oaths of allegiance to each other.</p>
        <p>Although membership in the Roundtable is generally hereditary, it is not permanent; House Daphnel was once a
            member of the Roundtable, but forfeited their seat to House Edmund after an internal dispute led to half of
            its members defecting to the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus and forming House Galatea.</p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>In Imperial Year 801, only a few decades after the secession of the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus from the
            Adrestian Empire, the nobles of the Leicester region also rebelled against the Empire, which found itself
            unable to reassert control. The Kingdom saw an opportunity to increase its political power and invaded,
            occupying and annexing Leicester. In 861, the three sons of the late King Klaus I divided the Kingdom
            between themselves, with one prince ruling Leicester as an archduke. In 881, upon the death of the archduke,
            the nobles of Leicester rejected his heir and launched a second bid for independence led by the influential
            Duke of Riegan, who himself belonged to a cadet branch of the Blaiddyd royal family. The Crescent Moon War
            ended in 901 with the nobles of Leicester gaining independence from the Kingdom and forming the Leicester
            Alliance.</p>
        <p>The neighboring kingdom of Almyra invaded the Alliance in 961. The invasion was narrowly turned back with the
            help of an army from the Adrestian Empire. In 1101, the Alliance cooperated with the Empire and the Kingdom
            to construct Fódlan's Locket, a fortress in the mountains of Fódlan's Throat designed to counter further
            invasions from Almyra.</p>
        <p>At some point, Godfrey von Riegan, son and heir of the reigning Duke Oswald von Riegan, passed away and left
            the house's future in jeopardy. In 1179, Claude von Riegan, grandson of Oswald through his mother, was
            legitimized as House Riegan's heir.</p>
