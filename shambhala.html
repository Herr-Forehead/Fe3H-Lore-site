        <h1>Shambhala</h1>
        <h2>general</h2>
        <p>Shambhala is the subterranean stronghold of Those Who Slither in the Dark, the descendants of Agartha. The
            entrance is located in the easternmost mountains of Hrym in the Adrestian Empire.

            In contrast to other places in Fódlan, Shambhala appears to be more advanced in technology consisting of
            neon lights along the pathways and on scriptures. Among the hallways are a series of complex piping systems
            used for unknown reasons as well as a doorway system that requires a device to open rather than a key.
            Titanus are also present around the city that act as guards.</p>
        <h2>Agartha</h2>
        <p>It is said that the people of Agartha once coexisted with the Nabateans, the children of the Goddess, but
            eventually turned away from the Goddess's protection and dedicated themselves to the advancement of
            technology for their prosperity. In time, they apparently became greedy, arrogant, and imperialistic,
            eventually challenging the Goddess herself for dominance. The Goddess warred with the Agarthans and
            destroyed their nation for their hubris. However, the conflict resulted in Fódlan being so devastated that
            the Goddess was forced to expend all of her energy to heal it, and thus fell into a long slumber in her Holy
            Tomb at Zanado. The surviving Agarthans retreated underground and their descendants became Those Who Slither
            in the Dark, who would devote centuries to plotting their revenge.

            At some point, Those Who Slither in the Dark secretly manipulated Nemesis into breaching the Holy Tomb and
            killing the progenitor goddess in order to forge weapons such as the Sword of the Creator and create the
            Crest of Flames from her body. Nemesis then slaughtered the Nabateans at Zanado and bestowed Crests upon his
            strongest warriors, the Ten Elites. However, Seiros would survive the massacre, and would go on to gather
            the remaining Nabateans, the Four Saints, create the Church of Seiros, as well as bestow her Crest of Seiros
            onto Wilhelm Paul Hresvelg, thereby helping him create the Adrestian Empire. This would eventually lead to
            Wilhelm following Seiros' will and clashing against Nemesis and his forces, starting the War of Heroes, a
            war that would span for many decades.

            Seiros ultimately prevailed and slew Nemesis in Imperial Year 91, but the failure of Nemesis did not deter
            the Agarthans from their path. Over a thousand years later, Those Who Slither in the Dark prepared to
            inflict their vengeance against the unsuspecting people of Fódlan.

            A book in the Shadow Library of Abyss titled "Romance of the World's Perdition" reveals that the Agarthans
            originally worshiped a pantheon of old gods from a land called Thinis.</p>
